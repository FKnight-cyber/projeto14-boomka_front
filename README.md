# Driven Education

## Projeto14 BoomKa

In this project we had to create an e-commerce like website using React,Nodejs and Mongodb.

We choose to make a mobile website inspired on https://www.kabum.com.br/ 

The products listed come from an API deployed on heroku, the user can register his account and delivery informations, it's possible to add products
into the cart even without login but to finish the purchase it's required, the payment method implemented was through PIX and Bank slip, the payment is
just visual, it register a purchase data into the API and can be found in My Purchases page, ( not a real purchase ).
